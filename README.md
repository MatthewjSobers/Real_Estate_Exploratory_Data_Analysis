# Real Estate Exploratory Data Analysis

This project examines a real estate dataset that provides insights into property sales and assessments across various towns.

### Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas

## Introduction
This project explores the real estate market by analyzing a comprehensive dataset, including property sales and assessment values. By leveraging this dataset, I aimed to uncover key insights into property value trends, sale amounts, and assessment ratios across various regions and property types.

## Project workflow

### Data Understanding
To begin this analysis, we get a broad overview of the dataset's structure and characteristics. This step involves examining the datasetâ€™s basic features, such as the types of variables, the range of values, and the overall shape of the data.

### Data Preparation / Cleaning
We clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming variables to ensure it is ready for analysis.

### Feature Understanding
Next we examine the individual features of the dataset to understand their distributions, characteristics, and potential influence on property sales and assessments.

### Feature Relationships
Here, the focus is on examining how different variables interact and influence one another. By using correlation analysis and visualizations, we can identify significant relationships, patterns, and dependencies between features. This often reveals which features are closely linked or potentially impact one another, such as the correlation between assessed value and sale amount. 

### Business Question Analysis
Finally we will attempt to answer the following question: Which factors should we prioritize to maximize the sales ratio and drive the highest profitability? This analysis identifies the key elements that most significantly impact returns in the real estate market.
