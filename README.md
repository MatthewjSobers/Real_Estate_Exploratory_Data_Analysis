# Real Estate Exploratory Data Analysis
This project examines a real estate dataset that provides insights into property sales and assessments across various towns. With features like 'Assessed Value,' 'Sale Amount,' and 'Sales Ratio,' the data captures critical aspects of property transactions, allowing us to explore patterns in pricing, property types, and regional trends. This analysis aims to identify trends, inconsistencies, and potential outliers in the real estate market to better understand factors that influence property values.
To do so we will go through four steps: Data understanding, data preparation, feature understaning and feature relationship.
Finally we will attempt to answer this question: Which year, town, property type and residential type should we chose to maximise the sale ratio (return the most profit)?
